## üèó **Architecture & Design Decisions**

### **Q: Why did you choose React 18 for this project?**

**A:** I chose React 18 for several key reasons:
- **Concurrent Features**: React 18's concurrent rendering helps with performance, especially important for data-heavy applications like hiring platforms
- **Automatic Batching**: Reduces unnecessary re-renders when handling multiple state updates
- **Suspense Improvements**: Better loading states and error boundaries for data fetching
- **Modern Ecosystem**: Best compatibility with TanStack Query and other modern libraries
- **Future-Proof**: Latest stable version ensures long-term maintainability

### **Q: Why did you use Vite instead of Create React App?**

**A:** Vite provides several advantages for modern development:
- **Lightning-Fast HMR**: Sub-second hot module replacement for rapid development
- **Native ES Modules**: Better performance in development with native browser ES modules
- **Optimized Builds**: Uses Rollup for production builds with better tree-shaking
- **Plugin Ecosystem**: Rich plugin system with excellent React support
- **Build Performance**: Significantly faster builds compared to Webpack-based solutions
- **Zero Configuration**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults

### **Q: Explain your choice of TanStack Query for state management.**

**A:** TanStack Query was chosen for several compelling reasons:
- **Server State Management**: Specifically designed for managing server state and API data
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching with automatic invalidation and refetching
- **Background Updates**: Keeps data fresh with background refetching
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback while API calls are in flight
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error states and retry logic
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent DevTools for debugging queries and cache
- **Performance**: Reduces unnecessary API calls through intelligent caching

## üéØ **Technical Implementation**

### **Q: How did you implement the deep linking feature?**

**A:** Deep linking was implemented through several layers:

1. **Router Configuration**: 
   ```jsx
   <Route path="jobs/:jobId" element={<JobDetailPage />} />
   <Route path="candidates/:candidateId" element={<CandidateDetailPage />} />
   ```

2. **Slug-based URLs**: Auto-generated slugs from titles for SEO-friendly URLs
   ```javascript
   const generateSlug = (title) => 
     title.toLowerCase()
          .replace(/[^\w\s-]/g, '')
          .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
   ```

3. **Dual Resolution**: API handlers that accept both numeric IDs and slugs
   ```javascript
   const identifier = params.id
   const numericId = parseInt(identifier)
   if (!isNaN(numericId)) {
     job = await db.jobs.get(numericId)
   } else {
     job = await db.jobs.where('slug').equals(identifier).first()
   }
   ```

### **Q: How did you implement the network simulation?**

**A:** Network simulation was implemented to create realistic development conditions:

1. **MSW Integration**: Used Mock Service Worker for API interception
2. **Realistic Latency**: 200-1200ms response times to simulate real network conditions
3. **Error Simulation**: 5-10% failure rate to test error handling
4. **Network Conditions**: 
   ```javascript
   const handleNetworkSimulation = async () => {
     await new Promise(resolve => 
       setTimeout(resolve, Math.random() * 1000 + 200)
     )
     if (Math.random() < 0.075) {
       return HttpResponse.json(
         { error: 'Network error' }, 
         { status: 500 }
       )
     }
   }
   ```

### **Q: How did you handle the export functionality?**

**A:** The export system supports multiple formats through a comprehensive implementation:

1. **Multi-format Support**: CSV, Excel, JSON, and PDF exports
2. **Dynamic Column Selection**: Users can choose which columns to export
3. **Bulk Export**: Export filtered or complete datasets
4. **Client-side Processing**: Uses libraries like xlsx and jsPDF for file generation
5. **Progress Indication**: Shows export progress for large datasets
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of export failures

```javascript
const exportData = async (data, format, columns) => {
  switch (format) {
    case 'csv': return exportToCSV(data, columns)
    case 'excel': return exportToExcel(data, columns)
    case 'json': return exportToJSON(data, columns)
    case 'pdf': return exportToPDF(data, columns)
  }
}
```

### **Q: Is the complete API specification implemented as requested?**

**A:** Yes! All the specified endpoints have been implemented and are fully working:

#### **Jobs API** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/jobs?search=&status=&page=&pageSize=&sort=` - Full search and filtering
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/jobs` - Creates jobs with `{ id, title, slug, status: "active"|"archived", tags, order }`
- ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/jobs/:id` - Supports both numeric IDs and slug-based updates
- ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/reorder` - Reorder with `{ fromOrder, toOrder }` and 10% error rate for rollback testing

#### **Candidates API** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidates?search=&stage=&page=` - Full filtering by stage and search
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/candidates` - Creates with `{ id, name, email, stage: "applied"|"screen"|"tech"|"offer"|"hired"|"rejected" }`
- ‚úÖ `PATCH /api/candidates/:id` - Stage transitions with validation
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/candidates/:id/timeline` - Complete candidate journey timeline

#### **Assessments API** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ `GET /api/assessments/:jobId` - Job-specific assessment retrieval
- ‚úÖ `PUT /api/assessments/:jobId` - Create/update assessments for specific jobs
- ‚úÖ `POST /api/assessments/:jobId/submit` - Submit responses with local storage

**Implementation Features:**
- Network simulation (200-1200ms latency)
- Error simulation (5-10% failure rate for reorder testing)
- IndexedDB persistence for offline capability
- Support for both numeric IDs and slugs
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling

## üîß **Problem Solving & Debugging**

### **Q: What was the most challenging bug you encountered and how did you solve it?**

**A:** The most challenging issue was the "Objects are not valid as a React child" error with dynamic icon rendering:

**Problem**: Icon components were being stored as references and rendered incorrectly
```jsx
// Problematic code
<item.icon className="h-4 w-4" />
```

**Root Cause**: React couldn't render component references directly as children

**Solution**: Used React.createElement for dynamic component rendering
```jsx
// Fixed code
{React.createElement(item.icon, { className: "h-4 w-4" })}
```

**Debugging Process**:
1. Identified the error pattern in console
2. Traced through component tree to find icon usage
3. Located multiple instances in navigation and data tables
4. Implemented consistent solution across all components
5. Added defensive coding patterns for future icon handling

### **Q: How did you handle the Dexie database key validation errors?**

**A:** The Dexie errors occurred because of slug-based routing conflicting with numeric database keys:

**Problem**: API handlers expected numeric IDs but received slugs
```javascript
const id = parseInt(params.id) // NaN for slugs like "marketing-manager-13"
await db.jobs.update(id, updatedData) // Failed with invalid key
```

**Solution**: Implemented dual identifier resolution
```javascript
const identifier = params.id
let job
const numericId = parseInt(identifier)
if (!isNaN(numericId)) {
  job = await db.jobs.get(numericId)
} else {
  job = await db.jobs.where('slug').equals(identifier).first()
}
```

3. **Design Tokens**: Consistent colors, spacing, and typography
4. **Dark Mode**: Complete theme system with CSS custom properties
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint consistency

**Benefits**:

### **Q: How did you ensure good performance?**

**A:** Performance optimization was implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading
2. **Query Optimization**: Intelligent caching with TanStack Query
3. **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
4. **Debounced Search**: Reduced API calls for search functionality
5. **Virtual Scrolling**: For large data sets (planned feature)
6. **Bundle Optimization**: Tree shaking and code elimination

**Monitoring**:
- Network tab analysis for API performance
- React DevTools for component re-renders
- Lighthouse scores for Core Web Vitals
